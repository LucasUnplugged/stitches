# Fork of Stitches [Temporary]

## Purpose

This fork addresses some issues that affect debugging, composition, and nesting of Stitches-styled components ([#650 - Friendly Class Names](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/650), [#675 - Composition](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/675), and [#690 - Specificity Conflicts](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/690)).

## Installation

Until these fixes get merged into the original Stitches, you can install a particular version of this fork (e.g., `v0.2.3`) via:

```
npm install 'https://gitpkg.now.sh/LucasUnplugged/stitches/packages/react?v0.2.3'
```
Or...
```
yarn add 'https://gitpkg.now.sh/LucasUnplugged/stitches/packages/react?v0.2.3'
```
**NOTE**: Replace `react` with `core`, if not using React; and `v0.2.3` with the latest version of this fork.

## Version Correlation

The version numbers of this fork correspond to the same version from the original, but with the above fixes added (without a version bump). I decided against a version bump so it would be easy to track if this fork is behind the original.
